# AI Companion v2 - Progress Journal

## Project Overview
Building an AI companion that deeply understands and evolves with users over time, eliminating the need for repeated context sharing through rich memory systems and continuous learning.

## Milestone 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- **Date**: August 10, 2025
- **Status**: Completed
- **What**: Established FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM, Next.js frontend, JWT authentication, and basic CRUD operations
- **Why**: Foundation needed for all subsequent features
- **Testing**: Backend tests passing, frontend running successfully

## Milestone 2: LLM Integration ✅
- **Date**: August 10, 2025
- **Status**: Completed
- **What**: Integrated Together AI API with Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free model, implemented chat interface with conversation management
- **Why**: Core AI functionality needed for user interactions
- **Testing**: Chat endpoint working, message creation and retrieval functional

## Milestone 3: Memory Integration and Context Retrieval ✅
- **Date**: August 10, 2025
- **Status**: Completed
- **What**: 
  - Implemented FAISS-based vector memory system with sentence-transformers embeddings
  - Created MemoryNode database model with proper indexing
  - Built MemoryService to orchestrate FAISS and database operations
  - Integrated memory storage in conversations and onboarding endpoints
  - Enhanced LLM reply endpoint with context retrieval from memory
  - Added memory-enabled feature flag for gradual rollout
- **Why**: 
    - **FAISS over alternatives**: Chosen for local, fast semantic search without external dependencies
    - **Hybrid approach**: Database stores metadata and content, FAISS handles vector similarity
    - **Context retrieval**: Enables AI to provide personalized responses based on user history
    - **Memory persistence**: Captures onboarding data and conversation context for long-term learning
- **Technical Decisions**:
    - Used `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (384 dimensions) for balance of quality and speed
    - Implemented `IndexFlatIP` for cosine similarity matching
    - Added recency boost and relevance thresholds for quality filtering
    - Used UUIDs for FAISS IDs to ensure uniqueness across users
- **Fixes Applied**:
    - Resolved `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError` by renaming `metadata` column to `memory_metadata`
    - Fixed `ImportError` for `FAISSMemoryStore` by adapting to functional interface
    - Corrected indentation issues in `MemoryService` class
    - Fixed import from `get_embeddings` to `embed_texts`
- **Testing**: All backend tests passing, memory system integrated and functional
- **Next**: Ready for Milestone 4: Advanced Memory Features

## Current Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + FAISS + sentence-transformers
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) with UUID primary keys
- **Memory**: FAISS vector database + SQLAlchemy metadata storage
- **LLM**: Together AI API with Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing

## Key Features Implemented
1. ✅ User authentication and registration
2. ✅ Multi-step onboarding with preference collection
3. ✅ Conversation management with pagination
4. ✅ LLM integration with Together AI
5. ✅ Memory system with FAISS vector search
6. ✅ Context-aware LLM responses
7. ✅ Memory persistence for onboarding and conversations

## Next Milestones
- **Milestone 4**: Advanced Memory Features (spiderweb model, weighted edges, temporal decay)
- **Milestone 5**: Memory Analytics and Insights
- **Milestone 6**: Fitness and Nutrition Tracking Integration
- **Milestone 7**: Advanced Personalization and Learning

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- Pydantic V2 migration (deprecation warnings)
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 compatibility
- FastAPI lifespan events (deprecation warnings)
- Streaming responses for LLM
- Memory system performance optimization
- Cost efficiency monitoring for LLM calls

## Testing Strategy
- Regular testing after each milestone to prevent overbuilding
- Backend unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for memory system
- Frontend testing for user flows
- Performance testing for memory retrieval
