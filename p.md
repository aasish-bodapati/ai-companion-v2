Where we are (today)
Auth working: Login via /api/v1/login/access-token is successful. CORS fixed and normalized in 
backend/app/main.py
, env parsing hardened in 
backend/app/core/config.py
.
API baseline aligned: Frontend uses /api/v1 with a shared client. React Query enabled (
frontend/src/app/client-layout.tsx
).
Core endpoints up: Conversations/messages, users, health. Canonical docs exist per docs/ground_truth/api_endpoints.md.
Seeds available: 
backend/app/scripts/seed_users.py
 for admin/test users.
Remaining cleanup: Remove deprecated files, duplicate scripts, local artifacts (per cleanup plan).
You can authenticate and should be able to hit protected endpoints (e.g., GET /api/v1/users/me) and conversation routes end-to-end now.

Gap to Product Vision
Persistent context: Long-term user and conversation memory beyond a single chat.
Tool integrations: Calendar (Google), docs (Notion/Drive), Slack/Email actions.
Proactive assistance: Background signals + triggers (summaries, conflicts, reminders).
Multi-device continuity: Mobile/web/desktop sessions synced and secure.
Delightful UX: Modern chat UX, drafts, inline actions, streaming, optimistic updates.
How we get there (phased roadmap)
Phase 1 — E2E Chat MVP (stabilize)

Verify chat flows: Use frontend/src/features/conversations/ with /api/v1/conversations/* for create/list/send/receive.
Typing/strictness: Ensure TypeScript types for responses are explicit (coding standard).
Streaming responses (optional): Add server-sent events or chunked responses in 
backend/app/api/endpoints/conversations.py
 to stream model outputs.
Clean up legacy files: Remove backend/main.py, backend/list_routes2.py, backend/test_auth.py, backend/test_main.py, artifacts: backend/minimal.db, backend/test.db, .coverage.
Phase 2 — Persistent Context (memory)

Data model: Add UserProfile, Preference, Memory tables in backend/app/models.py; migrations if applicable.
APIs: /api/v1/users/preferences, /api/v1/memories (create/query/attach to conversations).
Inference context: Middleware to assemble conversation + user memory into prompts; store summaries/embeddings for fast recall.
Frontend: Settings UI for preferences, memory visibility, and opt-outs in frontend/src/app/settings/.
Phase 3 — Tool Integrations (do, not just talk)

OAuth connectors: Google (Calendar/Drive), Notion, Slack.
Backend services: backend/app/services/integrations/ with typed clients; store tokens securely.
Actions: Endpoints to create/update events, docs, and send messages; route via AI “tool-use” layer.
Frontend UX: Integration management UI, consent flows, and action confirmation modals.
Phase 4 — Proactive Assistant

Schedulers & webhooks: Background jobs (e.g., APScheduler/Celery) in backend/app/workers/ to poll integrations and react to events.
Signals: Daily summary, conflicts, reminders; endpoints like /api/v1/assistant/suggestions.
Nudges: Frontend notifications and inbox for suggested actions.
Phase 5 — Multi-Device & Hardening

Sessions & tokens: Device-aware refresh tokens, revoke on logout across devices (JWT best practices).
Sync: Keep state consistent (React Query cache hydration + server snapshot endpoints).
Security & ops: HTTPS in prod, rate limits, audit logs, structured logs, error budgets, CI/CD.
Security and AI integration reminders (from project rules)
JWT on all protected endpoints; don’t log tokens.
HTTPS in production.
AI model: Use meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free via your configured provider; never OpenAI. Always include user_id and conversation_id.
Immediate next 3 actions (fastest value)
Verify conversations end-to-end:
Create/list a conversation, send/receive a message via 
frontend/src/features/conversations/api.ts
 using /api/v1/conversations/*.
If issues surface, I’ll instrument errors in 
api.ts
 and corresponding endpoints.
Cleanup leftovers (reduce noise and risk):
Remove backend/main.py, backend/list_routes2.py, backend/test_auth.py, backend/test_main.py, backend/minimal.db, backend/test.db, .coverage.
Update docs to reflect canonical entrypoint uvicorn app.main:app.
Design memory schema:
Propose Memory and Preference models + endpoints.
Add a minimal memory write during chat to start persistence.
If you want, I can:

Execute the cleanup now.
Or focus on getting conversation send/receive fully verified, then add the memory models.
Summary

We’ve crossed the biggest integration hump (auth/CORS). You’re 1–2 short steps from a stable E2E chat MVP.
Next, add persistent memory + integrations to align with the product vision of a proactive, context-aware companion.
I recommend: verify chat → cleanup → memory schema and endpoints.
