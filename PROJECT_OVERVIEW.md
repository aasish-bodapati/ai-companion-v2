## Data Models

### User & Profile
- **User**: Basic authentication (email, password, name)
- **OnboardingProfile**: Rich personal context including:
  - Identity (name, nickname, pronouns, birthday, location)
  - Interests (topics, hobbies, favorites)
  - Communication style (response style, tone, small talk level)
  - Goals (primary reason, personal goals, check-ins)
  - Boundaries (avoid topics, memory policy, recall preferences)
  - Fun (dream trip, random facts, AI persona preferences)

### Memory System
- **MemoryNode**: Stores content with metadata for vector search
  - Content and type classification
  - User association and conversation context
  - Timestamp and relevance scoring
  - FAISS vector ID for similarity search

### Conversations
- **Conversation**: Chat sessions with titles and timestamps
- **Message**: Individual messages with role (user/assistant/system) and content

## Key Technical Decisions

### Memory System Choices
- **FAISS over alternatives**: Chosen for local, fast semantic search without external dependencies
- **Hybrid approach**: Database stores metadata and content, FAISS handles vector similarity
- **Embedding model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for balance of quality and speed (384 dimensions)
- **Index type**: IndexFlatIP for cosine similarity matching

### LLM Integration
- **Together AI**: Chosen for cost-effective access to high-quality models
- **Llama-3.3-70B**: Large context window for comprehensive memory integration
- **Context injection**: System prompts enhanced with retrieved memories

### Database Design
- **UUID primary keys**: Ensures uniqueness across distributed systems
- **Cascade relationships**: Proper cleanup of related data
- **Indexing strategy**: Optimized for memory retrieval and user queries

## Current Limitations & Technical Debt

### Performance Considerations
- Memory system performance optimization needed
- Streaming responses for LLM not yet implemented
- Cost efficiency monitoring for LLM calls required

### Code Quality
- Pydantic V2 migration needed (deprecation warnings)
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 compatibility improvements
- FastAPI lifespan events deprecation warnings

### Feature Gaps
- No fitness/nutrition tracking yet implemented
- Limited proactive assistance capabilities
- Basic memory analytics only

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy
- Regular testing after each milestone to prevent overbuilding
- Backend unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for memory system
- Frontend testing for user flows
- Performance testing for memory retrieval

### Deployment
- Development: SQLite + local FAISS
- Production: PostgreSQL + persistent FAISS storage
- Environment-based configuration management

## Next Steps & Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities (Milestone 4)
1. Implement advanced memory features (spiderweb model, weighted edges)
2. Add temporal decay for memory relevance
3. Enhance context retrieval algorithms
4. Optimize memory system performance

### Short-term Goals (Milestones 5-6)
1. Build memory analytics and insights dashboard

5. Integration with external health and fitness platforms

## Conclusion

The AI Companion v2 project has established a solid foundation with a sophisticated memory system, rich user profiling, and AI integration. The current implementation successfully demonstrates the core vision of a context-aware AI companion that remembers user preferences and conversation history.

The planned fitness and nutrition tracking features will significantly enhance the app's utility as a comprehensive life companion, moving beyond conversation to active life management and coaching. The modular architecture and memory system provide a strong foundation for these future enhancements.

The project represents a significant step toward creating truly personalized AI companions that evolve with users over time, eliminating the need for repeated context sharing while providing increasingly relevant and helpful assistance.
