Always follow these instructions when generating content:
- Before answering, search the `project_reference_index.md` file and check the linked documentation.
- Treat all `.md` files as the single source of truth for project behavior, rules, and architecture.
- If documented information conflicts with a user request, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- Never assume missing details â€” ask the user instead.
- All new workflows or rules must be saved as a `.md` file and linked in the index.
